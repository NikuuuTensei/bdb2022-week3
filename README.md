# BDB2022 Week 3 Exercise

For Week 3, you will be developing smart contracts using REMIX IDE and Rinkeby Testing network. Week 3 will consist of four projects you can work on. I recommend you complete at least two projects. Or if you are feeling confident you can complete all the projects. 

## Projects

Week 3 will compose of four projects in total.

1. **Altcoin Project** (Set 1)
2. **IDO Project** (Set 1)
3. **NFT Project** (Set 2)
4. **INO Project** (Set 2)

It is recommended to complete 1 set of project for this week. You can follow the Altcoin track where in you will develop your own ERC-20 token and sell it with your IDO contract. Or you can follow the NFT Project where in you will develop your own ERC-721 token and sell it with your INO contract


### Setup
You are given an initial file that you can initially work on and at the end of the project you will arrive at a working code. After that you need to deploy it to Rinkeby Explorer so that we can check your work.

Clone or download zip this repository to your local device to get started.

The initial file is located inside the contract folder. Then look for the "set-1" folder if you are following the Altcoin track, or look for the "set-2" folder if you are following the NFT track.

You can use [REMIXD](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/remixd.html), a popular extension of the REMIX IDE where in you can connect directly to your local storage and start coding. Or if you are not confident, you can manually copy paste the smart contract code to REMIX IDE, then paste it back to your local repository whenever you are done coding. This way you can still commit your changes to GitHub and have it checked by the mentors.

## Altcoin Project

#### Grading Metrics
The following are the Grading Metrics on how well the student was able to complete the project. Each item correspond to a point/s which perfect points is 10.

1. Fix total supply of the ERC20 contract (2 points)
2. Deploy ERC20 contract to Rinkeby with
	a. Your own token name (2 points)
	b. Your own token symbol (2 points)
	c. Non-zero total supply (1 point)
3. A published smart contract code in Rinkeby Explorer (1 point)
4. Student should be able to send at least 100 of their tokens to the mentor (2 points)
